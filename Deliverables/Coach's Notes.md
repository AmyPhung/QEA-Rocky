**Modeling Rocky**

We first have to start by creating a mathematical representation of our inverted pendulum, Rocky.

How parameters were chosen:

Athlete Demographics: For at least one of the events, provide an
illustration of the block diagram used, as well as a pole diagram
and transfer function(s).

• Athlete Performance Information: Define the parameters used
to control theta and/or velocity for your athlete, as well as a
brief description of how you determined those parameters.
• Training Session Description: Describe how you extended your

analysis and implementation beyond the Stand-Up Rocky ac-
tivity (e.g., removed runaway tendencies, taught it how to

“run”, made it spin, made it dance). What new analysis did
you conduct and/or how was your implementation different
than Stand-Up Rocky? What process did you follow to get your
robot ready for the games? Which processes worked? Which
didn’t?
