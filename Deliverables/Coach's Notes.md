**Modeling Rocky**

We have to begin by creating an understanding of the system we want to control. For the sake of simplicity, we can model Rocky as an inverted pendulum with all of its mass centered as a point mass at its center of mass. This modeling decision is justified by the fact that Rocky acts like an inverted pendulum and has most of its mass centered around its battery pack. We take a more in depth look in figure [ELEPHANT].

Knowing this, we can create a free body diagram of the forces acting on Rocky to begin understanding how our system behaves. We know Rocky is being acted on primarily by two external forces: gravity pulling it downwards from its own weight, and a normal force pushing outwards from the center of its pivot. These forces are illustrated in figure [ELEPHANT];

Now we can begin creating a mathematical model of Rocky's behavior. Since we know the total forces acting on Rocky, we can write:

• Athlete Performance Information: Define the parameters used
to control theta and/or velocity for your athlete, as well as a
brief description of how you determined those parameters.
• Training Session Description: Describe how you extended your

analysis and implementation beyond the Stand-Up Rocky ac-
tivity (e.g., removed runaway tendencies, taught it how to

“run”, made it spin, made it dance). What new analysis did
you conduct and/or how was your implementation different
than Stand-Up Rocky? What process did you follow to get your
robot ready for the games? Which processes worked? Which
didn’t?
