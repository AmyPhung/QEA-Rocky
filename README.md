This repository contains code to make a segway robot drive along a parametric curve in preparation for the 2018 Robolympics! (aka - a project for Quantitative Engineering Analysis)

**See [here](https://photos.app.goo.gl/fkHDGmiQr6ArEZtM6) for final demo!**

Robot used: Balboa 32U4 Balancing Robot with custom attachments ([reference](https://www.pololu.com/category/210/balboa-robot-and-accessories)) 

For more information about the quantitative analysis we did, see this [paper](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1iAzoYLpepR2T3e_7MMJvq5O_UAfpUIqb)!

Here we have videos of our robot practicing for all of its events!

+ [Survivor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp10CplbuaE&feature=youtu.be) - testing to see how long the robot can stand
+ [Sprint](https://youtu.be/p1YsiRUwfDM) - testing to see how quicky the robot could drive forward without falling over
+ [Spin](https://youtu.be/5j-c7CFjFqE) - testing independent wheel control by spinning robot in place
+ [Bridge of Death](https://photos.app.goo.gl/fkHDGmiQr6ArEZtM6) - final demo!
